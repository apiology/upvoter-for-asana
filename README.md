## Contributions

This project, as with all others, rests on the shoulders of a broad
ecosystem supported by many volunteers doing thankless work, along
with specific contributors.

In particular I'd like to call out:

* [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) for the
  cookiecutter tool and associated examples, which keep my many
  projects building with shared boilerplate with a minimum of fuss.
* [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) and [Sam
  Verschueren](https://github.com/SamVerschueren) for the alfy tool,
  which provided an easy on-ramp to integrating this project with
  Alfred.
