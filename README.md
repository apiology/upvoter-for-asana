# Upvoter for Asana

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/upvoter-for-asana.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/upvoter-for-asana)

Chrome extension which quickly finds and increments integer custom
fields in Asana tasks from the Chrome Omnibox.

[![Available in the Chrome Web Store](https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-uploads/image/WlD8wC6g8khYWPJUsQceQkhXSlv1/tbyBjqi7Zu733AAKA5n4.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/upvoter-for-asana/olnbepiojfjbimgfnfdalnpkfbaphjjc)

This is useful if you're trying to track pain points in a backlog -
just throw a backlog feature task a quick upvote in real time as you
suffer through missing the feature, then go back later and take on the
most upvoted tasks!

## Using

Go to the URL bar ("Chrome Omnibox"), and type 'uv', a space, then
search for an Asana task.  You should see them pop up as suggestions.
Pick one, and your custom field will be uploaded!

Also, if you mark a task done which has dependent upvotable tasks, you
can click on the dependent task links to upvote those tasks.  See
[Shortcuts for Asana](https://github.com/apiology/shortcuts-for-asana)
for keyboard shortcuts to hit those links!
